Non-negative metrix factorization

This GitHub page contains all code used in the master thesis project by Ida Nyborg JÃ¸rgensen handed in June 2024.

"Trio data management" contains code for the data cleaning and the construction of the data matrices V_pat and V_mat for both the full data and the grouped data.

"Trio data intro" contains introductionary plots and numbers for the paternal and maternal datasets.

"Clustering" contains code for why the paternal data should be grouped due to age of the parents.

"Clustering maternal" contains code for why the maternal data should be grouped due to age of the parents.

"Why grouping" contains code for performing cross validation and BIC analysis for the regular NMF model for both the paternal data and the maternal data, on both the full and the grouped data.

"Trio data workbook" is the code for the results of the regular NMF analysis on both the paternal and maternal dataset, with the selected number of signatures.

"Trio data parametrized model selection" contains code for performing cross validation and BIC analysis for the parametrized NMF model for both the paternal and maternal datasets.

"Parametrized model" is the code for the results of the parametrized NMF analysis on both the paternal and maternal dataset, with the selected number of signatures.

"Poisson updates function" contains the update functions for both the regular and parametrized NMF models, as well as other supporting functions used throughout the thesis.
